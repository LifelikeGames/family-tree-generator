Family Tree Generator
=====================

Based on Random Family Tree Generator v.1.3  by Todd Stumpf:
http://code.google.com/p/random-family-tree-generator/
which in turn was based on an older version of Random Family Tree Generator
by Jeff Partridge, updated since to v2.0:
http://partridgez.com/japartridge/lineage2.html

All versions are under a
Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike-3.0 United States License.

This version by M.C.DeMarco will eventually support non-human or otherwise non-medieval family trees,
but for the moment I recommend using one of the original versions.
