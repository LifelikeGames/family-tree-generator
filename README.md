Family Tree Generator
=====================

Based on Random Family Tree Generator v.1.3  by Todd Stumpf:
http://code.google.com/p/random-family-tree-generator/
which in turn was based on an older version of Random Family Tree Generator
by Jeff Partridge, updated since to v2.0:
http://partridgez.com/japartridge/lineage2.html

The todo list from the google code project is here:
https://code.google.com/p/random-family-tree-generator/wiki/TODO

This version by M.C.DeMarco will eventually support non-human or otherwise non-medieval family trees,
but for the moment I recommend using one of the original versions.

Tree style adapted from http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-family-tree, 
http://thecodeplayer.com/experiments/css3-family-tree-multiple-parents.html.

No additional license restrictions are added in this version, except for copyright on the naming language,
which I will eventually replace with a better method of name generation.
