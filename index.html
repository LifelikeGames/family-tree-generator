<p>This version of the Family Tree Generator is by M. C. DeMarco.  In addition to generating reproducible random medieval family trees of descendants of a matriarch/patriarch pair (incrementally), it also supports the generation of non-human and otherwise non-medieval family trees, editing of any aspect of a generated tree, display of the output as an actual tree, a timeline, an indented list, or a CSV file, generation of full trees up to a specified date, various improved methods of name generation, a name list viewer, optional clan generation, and the display of detailed instructions for use.</p>

<p>This is an entirely client-side JavaScript program; it will run in a web browser without a web server.  However, jQuery and the fonts are loaded from Google, so an internet connection is required.  A demo version is available at <a href="http://mcdemarco.net/tools/family-tree-generator/">http://mcdemarco.net/tools/family-tree-generator/</a></p>

<a id="making-changes" class="anchor" href="#making-changes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>making changes</h2>

<p>To make your own changes to the family tree generator, you will need a copy of the code.  Click on <a href="https://github.com/mcdemarco/family-tree-generator/releases">releases</a> and download the latest one.  Unzip it if necessary and open lineage.html in your web browser.  (Please note that no obsolete browsers have been tested.)</p>

<p>If you do not know JavaScript, it should still be fairly simple to edit the names list or the demographic variables in one of the human/fantasy race files in the js/ directory to make your desired changes.  Please note that some name lists are just examples for the random name generator to work with, while others are used as-is.  (See the sausage section below for details.)</p>

<p>If you do know JavaScript, I would recommend making a new race along the lines of an existing one such as dwarf.js (but not homo.js).  You will need to load the file in lineage.html (with charset="utf-8" if your names use any non-ascii characters); if it is formatted correctly, it will be added to the human type/fantasy race list automatically.</p>

<p>The original version of the Family Tree Generator was under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike-3.0 United States License.
The google code version (on which this code was based) mentions the CC license as the "content license" and the GNU GPL v3 as the "code license."</p>

<p>The name generation markov chain code I used was in the public domain.
No licensing information was available for the tree style; I will inquire.</p>

<p>No additional license restrictions are added in this version, except for copyright on the various name lists and naming languages.</p>

<a id="sausage" class="anchor" href="#sausage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>sausage</h2>

<p>I made quite a few changes to the underlying code.  Most significantly, I stored the family tree in a data structure rather than in the html, which greatly simplified several chunks of code.</p>

<p>I threw out the existing name generation and added three methods of my own:  random selection from a name list (Modern names, Scottish names and clan names), generation by markov chain from a name list (Medieval names, Egyptian names, and dwarf names), and generation from a syllable list (dwerrow names).</p>

<p>I also abstracted more of the demographic statistics into variables or functions, which allowed me to change demographics when changing human type/fantasy race.  I removed the debugging code and simplified the UI code.</p>

<p>I added editing of the tree and automatic generation of descendants up to a certain date, as well as some complicated naming code (in dwerrow.js), for my own needs in writing fiction.</p>
